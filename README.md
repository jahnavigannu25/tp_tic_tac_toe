Tic Tac Toe Game
A classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. 
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
This project is a fun and interactive way to test your strategic thinking skills against a friend or the computer.
